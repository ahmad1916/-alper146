This code defines a function plotter application using Python and PySide6 (a Qt framework binding for creating GUI applications). It begins by importing necessary libraries: sys for command-line arguments, numpy for numerical operations, sympy for symbolic mathematics, and matplotlib for plotting. The ApplicationWindow class inherits from QtWidgets.QMainWindow to create the main application window. Inside its constructor, it sets up the main window, assigns it a central widget, and uses a grid layout to arrange its components. The GUI includes labels (QLabel) and textboxes (QLineEdit) for user input: one for entering a mathematical function of x, and two others for specifying the range of x values (minimum and maximum). The components are styled with fonts and tooltips for better usability. Finally, the if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures the script runs as a standalone application, initializing the application, displaying the main window, and entering the Qt event loop to respond to user interactions. This is a foundational setup for a function plotting tool.
